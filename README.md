=> studyeasy is site in which  student can get the assighnments,books,testpaper etc.. very easily .
=> In online education maintaining  files, assignment,books , report etc.. is very hard so we studyEasy 
 Provide student to maintain their assignments on site to privately .
=> One of the feature of study Easy is that in our site student can get their verified assignment solution 
And also student can put their solution to the site and that solution is visible to All students.
=> In this site we use react as frontend framework .Due to the less time  our team  not able to implement 
Our full project idea . Our team try to add backend part also (express js,mongo db , node js) but due to
The lack of knowledge ,resources and last moment bugs we are not able to add backend part .
